## The most vulnerable demographic are people who are 60 years old or older

The most vulnerable in this age group are people who are 80 year old or older. Case fatality rate for this group is expected to be close to 15% - that means of all the people who get infected and are  80 year old or older 15% will die.

Therefore it is important for all families to isolate their elderly as much as possible limiting physical (but not emotional because social interaction is very important to maintain the quality of life) contact with their elderly family members to minimum. 

Reasonable sanitary cautions should also be followed; regular hand washing, disinfecting items and food handed over to eldery, etc..


### How can you help?

Every kind of help is needed!

The campaign needs different contributions. 

It is important to back displayed generalizations with the actual research as much as possible.

This has to be translated into Spanish.

The message must be shared as much as possible and to the highest decision makers as possible. This is crucial.
